Lab Wiki with infos and rules

## Wiki
This lab wiki is under construction. With your help, it will have all the information you need to get started, including tasks that need to be done upon arrival, day-to-day housekeeping duties, forms and flyers, programming and stats tips, lab protocols, information about accessing the high-performance computing cluster and lab servers and file organization. Edit it when you obtain information that will be useful for others to know!

## Slack
Slack will be used as the primary means of lab communication. When posting messages or looking for updates, check the appropriate channel: #general for lab announcements, #lab-meetings for notes or communication related to lab meetings, #papers for sharing links to lab-relevant papers and discussing them, #code-tips for sharing wisdom on code writing or asking (and answering) the coding questions of others, #methods for sharing and discussing lab protocols and data analysis, #stats to ask and answer questions about statistical analyses, and #random for non-work-related chatting that is best kept out of the work-related channels.

Try to keep each channel on topic, so that people can subscribe only to the channels that concern them. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages. If you have to send attachments (e.g., papers) or send messages that include out-of-lab recipients, use email. If it’s an emergency and Jens isn’t responding on Slack, email him.

Full-time lab members should install Slack on their computers and/or phones. Part-time lab members should also check Slack regularly. You should of course feel free to ignore Slack on evenings and weekends – and Jens probably will, too!

## Calendar
The Bast Lab calendar is used to keep track of lab events, including any lab meetings just for our lab, and birthdays! It is also used to indicate travel and holiday dates (e.g., “Jens away” for August 1-7), so that other people know when you aren’t available. You are not obligated to put down your travel dates, but they are useful for planning purposes (e.g., Jens will know not to bother with lab meetings if no one is around; or if he is writing a grant, it helps to know if you will or won’t be available to provide data, etc).

## Trello
The Trello lab organizer is used for project and lab management purposes. This provides an overview of projects, lab organization, upcoming conferences and workshops and so on. It will remind us of all things that have to be done and by whom. Additionally, this can be used to collect a wish- and shopping list for lab and office equipment needed.

## Maps for sampling spots
This custom google maps will be used to pinpoint sampling spots and other information, so we do not ever forget, where and when we sampled animals or where the good spots are.

## Docs for writing manuscripts
To write papers, Jens will use GoogleDocs and GoogleSheets and you are encouraged to do so too. This has the big advantage, that comments and edits from multiple people can be easily seen and the version history can be accessed at all times. It works perfectly well with the integrated Paperpile reference management tool.

## Github
The lab’s GitHub should be used to share code, and data with the world. Only share data after you’ve spoken to Jens (we don’t want to share the data too soon, before you’ve had a chance to look at it thoroughly yourself). When you share code, make sure it’s flawless, because we don’t want to distribute buggy code to the world! Have other lab members check it if possible. Be aware that this is only meant for scripts and small files for analyses and not for uploading (genomic) data. The data can be put in temporary folders that are not synced with github. Ask others how to use github and check the wiki for more information.
